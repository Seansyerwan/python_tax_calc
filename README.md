# Tax calculator

Users input the income as prompted, and the tax calculator calculates their Income Tax, PRSI, and USC respectively. Data is then stored in a csv file in the same directory as the file. 
Furthermore, they can input their tax credit to have it taken off. 


Note: Please do not use this for calculating your taxes! This is simply a project I am doing in my off time.
